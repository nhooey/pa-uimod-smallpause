# Small Pause #
A Planetary Annihilation UI Mod

## Description ##
This is a modification for the popular real-time strategy game: Planetary Annihilation. It makes the pause dialogue and button much smaller so it doesn't get in the way of the rest of the interface while the game is paused. This is useful for modders who want to test their UI while the game is paused.
